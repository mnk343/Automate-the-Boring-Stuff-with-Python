list 

for the sort attribute

we have these two parameters:

1) reverse
set a.sort(reverse=True) to sort the array in reverse order

2) key
set a.sort(key=str.lower) to sort after changing everything in lower caase
if not write this then sort ASCIIbetically. like 'Z' comes before 'a'

copy module

if we want to pass a list in a function and dont want its value to be changed , then we should use copy

import copy
a=[1,2,2]

b=copy.copy(a)

if the list contains inner lists use deepcopy() method instead
